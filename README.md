# **Stationhead Android Takehome Assessment**

**Welcome!**

We created this project to test your Android skills through hands-on development.

At the bottom of this email is a Github Classrooms link which will let you fork the repo you will be working on.  Do not click on that link until you have read and understand all of these instructions.

To complete this assessment, you will need to be familiar with Android development, the Kotlin language, the basics of Git and Github, and a little bit of RxJava.  If you're unfamiliar with any of these, you may want to spend some time before starting the assessment getting up to speed.

### Project

For this project, we're going to create a toy app for displaying Top 40 charts of a selection of music genres and display a skewmorphic representation of a record playing.

It does not implement music playback.

Here are the specifications for the app:

[Specifications](https://stationhead-vinyl-mock-data.s3.amazonaws.com/Specifications.html)

### Evaluation

We will be evaluating your code in two ways:

- **Does it implement the specifications?** For this, we'll primarily be looking at the App in the role of a user.
- **Is the code clean, organized, and readable?** For this we'll be reading your code like a colleague who needs to add a feature extending what you've built.

### Time

You can control how much time you spend working on this assessment. You can either:

- take as long as you need to completely implement the specifications to the best of your ability, or
- implement as many of the features as you can within **4 hours**.  When those 4 hours are up submit your work, even if it's unfinished.

You will not be penalized for choosing either option.

### Rules

You may:

- Use your own development environment and any tools you like.
- Consult any resource (including the internet) you'd like during the task.
- Add and use external libraries.
- Review the instructions, specifications, and mockups before your time starts.
- Email me if you have any questions.

You must **not:**

- Ask for direct help, including on Stack Overflow or similar forums. The work you submit must be your own.
- Share any part of this assessment with others or post any part of it on the public internet.
- Edit pre-existing code. In particular, the GetGenreList class cannot be modified in any way
    - Files and code that can be edited will be clearly marked with TODOs or comments.

You should:

- Create a new branch for your development work
- Submit your work as an unmerged pull request to the main branch of your forked repo.
- Add a description to your PR request, especially if there is work left unfinished.

**DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL YOU'RE READY TO START**
